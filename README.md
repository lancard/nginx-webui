## Quick Setup

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose

- [Docker Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker-Compose Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file similar to this:

```yml
version: '3.7'
services:
  nginx-webui:
    image: lancard/nginx-webui
    container_name: nginx-webui
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Seoul
    ulimits:
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 81:81
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - nginx-webui-data:/data
      - nginx-webui-cert:/etc/letsencrypt
      - nginx-webui-log:/var/log/nginx
      - nginx-webui-logrotate-config:/etc/logrotate.d

volumes:
  nginx-webui-data:
  nginx-webui-cert:
  nginx-webui-log:
  nginx-webui-logrotate-config:
```

3. Set environment variable if you need (it not set, nginx-webui will generate keys automatically and you can find keys in docker logs)
```
JWT_SECRET=abcdefgh
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
TRUST_PROXY=1
```
Setting JWT_SECRET is beneficial in scenarios such as server reboots or when load balancing across multiple nginx-webui servers.
To obtain the real IP address of the client, set the TRUST_PROXY environment variable. (Specify how many proxies are in front of the server.)

4. Run docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs # for check admin password
```

5. Log in to the Admin UI

The 'administrator' user password is randomly generated by first time.
you can check it by 'docker-compose logs'

When your docker container is running, connect to it on port `81` for the admin interface.
(The connection is secured with a self-signed certificate. If you receive a security warning message, ignore it and continue)

[https://127.0.0.1:81](http://127.0.0.1:81)

Default Admin User:
```
id: administrator
password: (get it from docker-compose logs)
```

6. Setup Config

Refer Screenshot 4

7. Use API for CI/CD

```
curl --insecure -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" "https://localhost:81/api/upstream/${upstream-name}/${backend-address}/enable"
curl --insecure -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" "https://localhost:81/api/upstream/${upstream-name}/${backend-address}/disable"
```

---

## Reset password

```
cd /admin
npm run password
```

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from a previous version, please refer to the [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for detailed steps and compatibility notes.

---

## Install sshd for development (for contribution)

- Create a volume and make id_rsa.pub file then attach the volume to /root/.ssh
- It will open ssh server automatically.
- change directory /root/nginx-webui/admin
- execute 'npm run watch'
- it will open 7777 port

---

## Built With

- server side: npm, nodejs, express
- client side: daisyui, tailwind, esbuild, jquery, dayjs, chart.js
